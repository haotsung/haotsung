## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tsung-Hao Chen

I'm a Master's graduate in Biomedical Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, with a strong focus on neuroimaging, machine learning, and computational biology.


ðŸ”¬ My research interests lie at the intersection of brainâ€“behavior modeling, dimensionality reduction, and predictive modeling using tools like:
- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch)
- Machine learning frameworks (Julearn, Junifer)

ðŸ“˜ My masterâ€™s thesis focused on comparing different dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, ICA, NMF, UMAP, Autoencoder) to extract latent behavioral components from the Human Connectome Project, and predict them from resting-state fMRI using Kernel Ridge Regression. Check it out [here](https://github.com/haotsung/HCP_behavioral_prediction)! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for PhD opportunities in computational biology, AI for healthcare, or cancer research, particularly involving multi-omics data integration and uncertainty quantification.
